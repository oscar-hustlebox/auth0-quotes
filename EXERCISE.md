# Full-Stack Exercise

We’d like you to build a "shared quotes list" app that leverages Auth0. Visitors to the site will be able to browse the list of Quotes.

## Deliverables

- Implemented as a Single Page Application.
- Main view that lists items from the [public quotes API routes](README.md#API).
- Visitors can authenticate via Auth0.
- Authenticated users can create, update, delete, and filter their own quotes ([using the user quotes API routes](README.md#API) or your own)

## Expectations

- While the API routes with underlying DB access are provided by the service, you will need to implement the functionality for enabling user login, logout, restricted access to routes, etc.
- This code in its current state has been tested on Heroku, but you are welcome to choose another PaaS such as Vercel or Netlify.
- Please make sure to discuss with the team before you start coding what’s your plan to deliver a minimum working prototype and what would be the steps to take it to the next level.

### Optional

- Improve the UX with sorting, pagination, or any extra feature.
- Make the app more reliable with tests, validation, error handling.
- Whatever else you think may yield a great user and developer experience.

## What we assess

- Coding skills
- Research ability
- Written communication
- Autonomy
- Interaction with the team
- Attention to details
- Customer/Developer orientation

## Technology

Even though you are free to choose any technology to complete this exercise, the current ones configured in this exercise scaffold are similar to our production stack.

### Front-end

- React
- Typescript

### Back-end

- NodeJS
- Express
- PostgreSQL

## Considerations

You are not restricted to the technologies or configurations provided in this starter setup. You are welcome to modify, augment, and swap anything as you see fit. Feel free to jump into discussion for picking the stack you feel more comfortable working with.

The idea is to iterate, so you can get a sense of the way we work and we can understand how you work, based on a real task.

We value your time and ask that you dedicate no more than 10-15 hours to this exercise and submit all work within 7 days. If you believe it will take you longer, please let us know and we will adjust. All commits can be pushed to this repository and any supporting documentation, designs, etc. can be shared in the Slack channel. We will schedule a demo call after the exercise where you can present and discuss the project with us.

Feel free to integrate any frameworks or libraries that align with your preferred workflow and design philosophy (UI, state management, routing, testing, etc.), including any offered by Auth0 for authorization needs.

Under no circumstances will we use the code you create during the exercise.​ Feel free to put restrictive licenses on your repo if you are concerned and would like to take extra measures. We value transparency and want to be very upfront that the exercise is not an attempt to get free work done.
